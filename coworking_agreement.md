## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

Slack, zoom a laptop and the files!

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will both write all the functions, keep eachother updated via Slack, then meet up as necessary via Zoom. We will pick the most optimal functions for our final implementation.
