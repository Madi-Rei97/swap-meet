class Decor:


    """Has an attribute id that is by default a unique integer
Holds 2 integer attributes width and length
Both of these values should be 0 by default
When we instantiate an instance of Decor, we can optionally pass in integers 
with the keyword arguments width and length
Has a function get_category that returns "Decor"
Has a stringify method that returns "An object of type Decor with id <id value>. 
It takes up a <width value> by <length value> sized space."
For example, if we had a Decor instance with an id of 123435, width of 3, and length of 7, 
its stringify method should return "An object of type Decor with id 12345. It takes up a 3 by 7 sized space.

All three new classes and the Item class have an attribute called condition, 
which can be optionally provided in the initializer. The default value should be 0

All three new classes and the Item class have an instance method named condition_description, 
which should describe the condition in words based on the value, assuming they all range from 0 to 5.

These can be basic descriptions (eg. 'mint', 'heavily used') but feel free to have fun with these 
(e.g. 'You probably want a glove for this one...").
The one requirement is that all the classes share the same condition_description behavior.

Tip: Importing Item
You'll need to refer to Item in order to declare it as a parent. To reference the Item class from these modules, try this import line:

from swap_meet.item import Item """

    def __init__():

        pass
